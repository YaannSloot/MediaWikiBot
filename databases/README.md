# Pre-made database files you can use in your configuration
Use any of these files individually or combine them into one larger file

Must be placed in the database directory located in the bots working directory

Must be named endpoints.csv or else the bot will ignore it

You can only use one endpoints.csv file at the moment. Files in subdirectories will not load
